# monoid-statistics parallelizable constant space estimators

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shimuuar/monoid-statistics.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Shimuuar/monoid-statistics)

Monoids for calculation of statistics of sample. This approach allows to
calculate many statistics in one pass over data and possibility to parallelize
calculations. However not all statistics could be calculated this way.
